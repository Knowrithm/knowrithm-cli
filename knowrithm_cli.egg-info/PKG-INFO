# Knowrithm CLI

A comprehensive Python command-line interface for the Knowrithm enterprise multi-agent chatbot platform. The CLI provides full access to the REST API, enabling developers and operators to manage agents, ingest content, handle leads, analyze conversations, and query analytics directly from the terminal.

## 🎉 What's New - Enhanced User Experience!

The CLI has been significantly improved with user-friendly features:

- **✨ Name-Based Lookups**: Use agent names instead of UUIDs (`knowrithm agent get "Support Bot"`)
- **🎯 Context Management**: Set active agent/conversation once, use everywhere
- **🧙 Interactive Wizards**: Step-by-step guided agent creation
- **📊 Beautiful Formatting**: Table, tree, CSV, and YAML output formats
- **🔍 Fuzzy Matching**: "Did you mean?" suggestions for typos
- **⚡ Quick Commands**: Update agents without complex JSON payloads
- **💡 Better Errors**: Meaningful messages with helpful suggestions

### 🚀 NEW: Interactive Features!

The CLI now includes modern interactive features for a better user experience:

- **⌨️ Command Auto-Completion**: Press `Tab` to auto-complete commands in interactive mode
- **🎯 Arrow-Key Navigation**: Use arrow keys to navigate menus instead of typing numbers
- **📜 Command History**: Navigate through previous commands with `↑` and `↓`
- **🔍 History Search**: Press `Ctrl+R` to search through command history
- **✨ Visual Feedback**: See highlighted selections before confirming

**Try it now:**
```bash
# Enter interactive mode with auto-completion
knowrithm

# Create an agent with arrow-key menus
knowrithm agent create --interactive
```

- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone or download the CLI package**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/knowrithm-cli
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   
   # Activate on Linux/macOS
   source .venv/bin/activate
   
   # Activate on Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the CLI in editable mode**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   knowrithm --version
   knowrithm --help
   ```

The `knowrithm` executable will be available on your `$PATH` after installation.

## Quick Start

### 0. Launch Interactive Dashboard (NEW!)

```bash
# View the beautiful Knowrithm dashboard with all commands
knowrithm dashboard
```

This displays a gorgeous ASCII logo and interactive menu with all available commands, quick actions, and helpful information!

### 1. Initial Setup

```bash
# Set API endpoint
knowrithm config set-base-url https://app.knowrithm.org/api

# Login
knowrithm auth login
# Enter your email and password when prompted
```

### 2. Create Your First Agent (Interactive Mode)

```bash
# Launch interactive wizard
knowrithm agent create --interactive

# Follow the prompts:
# - Agent name: "Support Bot"
# - Description: "Customer support agent"
# - Configure advanced settings? No
```

### 3. Set Active Agent (Context)

```bash
# Set as active agent
knowrithm context set agent "Support Bot"

# Now you can use commands without specifying the agent
knowrithm agent stats
knowrithm agent test --query "Hello, how can you help?"
```

### 4. List Agents (Beautiful Table Format)

```bash
# View all agents in a formatted table
knowrithm agent list --format table
```

### 5. Get Agent Details by Name

```bash
# No need to remember UUIDs!
knowrithm agent get "Support Bot" --format tree
```

**That's it!** You're ready to use the CLI. See [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md) for more examples and [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for a command cheat sheet.

## Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. **Set the API base URL**
   ```bash
   knowrithm config set-base-url https://your-knowrithm-instance.com
   ```
   
   For local development:
   ```bash
   knowrithm config set-base-url http://localhost:8000
   ```

2. **Configure TLS verification (optional)**
   ```bash
   # Disable for self-signed certificates (development only)
   knowrithm config set-verify-ssl --disable
   
   # Enable for production
   knowrithm config set-verify-ssl --enable
   ```

3. **View current configuration**
   ```bash
   knowrithm config show
   ```

4. **Get configuration file path**
   ```bash
   knowrithm config path
   ```

### Configuration File

Configuration is stored in `~/.knowrithm/config.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "base_url": "https://app.knowrithm.org",
  "verify_ssl": true,
  "auth": {
    "jwt": {
      "access_token": "...",
      "refresh_token": "...",
      "expires_at": 1234567890
    },
    "api_key": {
      "key": "...",
      "secret": "***"
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication

The CLI supports three authentication methods:

### 1. Email/Password (JWT)

**Login and store tokens**
```bash
knowrithm auth login --email admin@example.com --password
# Password will be prompted securely
```

**Check current user**
```bash
knowrithm auth me
```

**Refresh expired tokens**
```bash
knowrithm auth refresh
```

**Logout and clear tokens**
```bash
knowrithm auth logout
```

### 2. API Key/Secret

**Store API credentials**
```bash
knowrithm auth set-api-key --key YOUR_KEY --secret YOUR_SECRET
```

**Clear API credentials only**
```bash
knowrithm auth clear --api-key
```

### 3. Public Registration

**Register a new company admin account**
```bash
knowrithm auth register --payload '{
  "email": "admin@newcompany.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123!",
  "company_name": "New Company LLC",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe"
}'
```

Or using a file:
```bash
knowrithm auth register --payload @registration.json
```

### Validation

**Validate current credentials**
```bash
knowrithm auth validate
```

### Authentication Strategy Selection

Most commands accept `--auth` to specify the authentication method:

```bash
# Auto-select (default: tries JWT first, then API key)
knowrithm agent list --auth auto

# Force JWT authentication
knowrithm agent list --auth jwt

# Force API key authentication
knowrithm agent list --auth api-key

# No authentication (public endpoints only)
knowrithm system health --auth none
```

  "agent_ids": ["<agent_id_1>", "<agent_id_2>"]
}'
```

## Advanced Usage

### Working with JSON Payloads

**Inline JSON:**
```bash
knowrithm agent create --payload '{"name": "Test Agent", "status": "active"}'
```

**From file:**
```bash
knowrithm agent create --payload @agent.json
```

**From stdin:**
```bash
echo '{"name": "Dynamic Agent"}' | knowrithm agent create --payload @-
```

### Asynchronous Task Handling

Many operations return a `task_id` for async processing:

```bash
# Wait for completion (default for most operations)
knowrithm agent create --payload @agent.json --wait

# Return immediately without waiting
knowrithm agent create --payload @agent.json --no-wait

# Manually poll task status
knowrithm system task-status <task_id>
```

### Pagination

List commands support pagination:

```bash
# Default: page 1, 20 items
knowrithm agent list

# Custom pagination
knowrithm agent list --page 2 --per-page 50
```
